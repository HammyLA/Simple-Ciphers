# Simple Ciphers

Welcome to **Simple Ciphers**!  

This web application allows users to quickly encrypt and decrypt messages using a variety of classic and modern cryptographic ciphers. It is designed primarily for fun, allowing users to generate encrypted messages to send to friends, giving them a "spy-like" experience. While this app can be used for educational purposes, it does not provide in-depth explanations of the cryptosystems.  

## 🚀 Features  

### **Classical Ciphers**
- **Caesar Cipher** – A simple shift cipher that replaces each letter with one a fixed number of places away.  
- **Substitution Cipher** – A more advanced cipher that substitutes letters based on a predefined key.  
- **One-Time Pad** – A theoretically unbreakable cipher that uses a random key the same length as the message.  
- **Vigenère Cipher** – A polyalphabetic cipher that extends the Caesar Cipher with a keyword.  

### **Stream Ciphers**
- **A5/1 Cipher** – A stream cipher used in GSM encryption.  
- **RC4 Cipher** – A widely used stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed.  

### **Block Ciphers**
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** – A widely studied block cipher with 56-bit keys.  
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** – A secure modern cipher used worldwide.  
- **TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm)** – A lightweight block cipher with simple structure.  

## 🛠 Setup  

### **Requirements**
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:  
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest stable version recommended)**  
- **npm** (included with Node.js, or install separately via `npm install -g npm`)  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-ciphers.git
   cd simple-ciphers
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will launch the application on a local development server.

## 🎮 Usage  
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your terminal).  
2. Select a cipher from the list.  
3. Enter your message and key, then encrypt or decrypt.  
4. Share the ciphertext with friends to decode!
